# watches

I'm attempting to build some real nice rebbleos hardware. 

---

## the watches

Right now there's just the "big board" prototype. After that there'll be a smaller prototype that can actually be worn on the body and then, hopefully, an actually small watch. (assuming all the prototypes work as designed lol).

## contributing

Hit me up on the discord, documentation is still pretty light.

Datasheets go in ./common/datasheets, kicad libraries in ./common/kicad-libs. I've been using the nightly kicad 5.99 builds.
